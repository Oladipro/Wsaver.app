# Wsaver.app
Wsaver is a lightweight, multilingual WhatsApp and Business Status Saver app that lets you easily download, view, and manage statuses.
💡 Monetization Strategy
Wsaver uses banner ads displayed non-intrusively within the app and rewarded ads offered for bulk saves to maximise revenue while preserving an excellent user experience.

🔒 Privacy Policy
Wsaver does not collect or store any personal data. All saved statuses remain on the user’s device. The app requests storage permissions solely to access and save media statuses. Users can view the full Privacy Policy via the hosted link included in the app and Play Store listing.

👨‍💻 Developer Notes
This app is designed with a zero-tolerance approach to errors. It includes robust permission handling, empty state UI displays, and a dark mode toggle to enhance usability. The UI is intentionally minimalist with emerald green accents for a calm, premium feel.

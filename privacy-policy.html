  <h1>Privacy Policy for Wsaver</h1>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how Wsaver (“the App”), developed by <strong>Suly Technology</strong> (https://suly.xyz), collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our application.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    Wsaver does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from its users. The app solely requests access to your device storage to read, display, and save WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business statuses locally on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Storage Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The App requires storage permissions to access the WhatsApp status folder and save images or videos you choose to download. These files remain strictly on your device and are not uploaded to any external servers.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Ads and Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Wsaver uses Google AdMob for displaying ads to support free usage. AdMob may collect certain information, such as device identifiers, to provide personalised ads. We do not have access to or control over this data.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We prioritise the security of your data. As Wsaver does not store user data on external servers, there is minimal risk of data breach from our end. However, always ensure your device is secured with appropriate safeguards.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted within the app and on this page. Continued use of the app after changes implies acceptance of the revised policy.
  </p>
